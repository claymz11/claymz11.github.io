        <h2>Inspirational Website: <a href="https://jhofffilms.com/" target="_blank">Jhofffilms</a></h2>
        <p>First of all, I apologize for the profane nature of this website. That aspect of it's content is not what I'm taking inspiration from, but with that being said, I do really appreciate the way that they express themselves however they want. Their site shows exactly who they are, what they do, and they don’t try to cater to anyone in particular, they just do what they feel is right and ultimately what they want to do overall. If someone doesn’t like it, then they don’t like it; maybe someone else will, and many do, inlcuding me. I also think that the interface design is slick and the content itself is something that I might want to delve into a little bit in the future.</p>
