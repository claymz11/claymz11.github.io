            <p>For my Independent Project, I would like to continue where I left off with an app design I started in SMAD 203. The first two projects in that class were centered around developing an app based on Downtown Harrisonburg and was primarily focused on completing the user research stages of software development. This consisted of conducting interviews, compiling that data to create personas, establish design requirements, and making user story grids and narratives. We briefly tinkered with some possible interface designs, but all that consisted of were some really rough wireframes, a sitemap, and inventory spreadsheet. My goal with this project is to review and update some of the data I collected and use the skills I learned in SMAD 317 to develop some high-fidelity interface prototypes along with updated information architectures and sitemaps.</p>
            <p>The app is called “Downtown Gifts and Thrifts” and its purpose is to help students attending the surrounding colleges in the area such as JMU, EMU, and Bridgewater College discover and support the locally owned shops of Downtown Harrisonburg. I’m excluding many of the great restaurants, bars, and coffee houses that downtown has to offer and focusing primarily on the small, unique stores. I specifically chose college students as the target audience because most of them aren’t local to the area and typically are only in Harrisonburg during active school semesters. These happen to be particularly busy times as well, so they’re more likely to miss out on what downtown has to offer. This app is meant to alleviate some of those inconveniences by streamlining the process of finding cool shops that interest them straight from their phones, now with the added benefit of deterring droves of people from walking out and about instead of staying at home and reducing the spread of COVID-19. Users will be able to see what each store has to offer, find directions to it, and make a quick trip there and back.</p>
            <p>An issue I’d like to tackle and keep in mind based on issues related to Technically Wrong is rethinking the personas I’ve already developed. I believe they worked fine at the time I created them, but they could benefit from a revisit with a new approach more aligned with the insight coming from the book. In particular, considering the ideas of “normal people” and designing for stress cases.</p>
